        # Installation
        You can retrieve the colorconverter package from the Python Package Index https://pypi.org/ using pip. First make sure you have python3 and python3-pip installed. Then you can start by making a `requirements.txt` file in your working directory with the colorconverter requirement in it. You can add any other packages to your requirements here, each as a separate line.
        
        requirements.txt:
        ```
        mindpowered-colorconverter>0
        ```
        Now you can use pip to install the colorconverter package: `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
        If you would like to update the package, simply run the above command again.
